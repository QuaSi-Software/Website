[Energiewendebauen](https://www.energiewendebauen.de/) is the official organisation tasked with connecting research groups funded by the Germany Ministry for Economy and Climate Action (BMWK) and provide a plattform for exchanging the results of research projects. The Projektleitungstreffen are regular conferences where participants of the various research projects can present new results and discuss current topics in workshops.

The poster provides an overview of the project and three important software components (namely GenSim, ReSiE and SoDeLe), as well as the overarching goals of the project.
