We are proud to present our new website, which offers news, contacts and other information on the QuaSi project.

The website is intended as a central place to gather all relevant information on the project and its
software components, as well as link to other websites with more detailed information, such as the documentation
and the repositories hosted on GitHub.

As with the other components of the project, we release the source code for the website as open source code. Feel
free to participate if you have improvements in mind or want to add information to the website. For those
technically inclined: it runs as static websites hosted by GitHub pages and is generated via Jekyll.
