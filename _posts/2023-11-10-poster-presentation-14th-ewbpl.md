[Energiewendebauen](https://www.energiewendebauen.de/) is the official organisation tasked with connecting research groups funded by the Germany Ministry for Economy and Climate Action (BMWK) and provide a plattform for exchanging the results of research projects. The Projektleitungstreffen are regular conferences where participants of the various research projects can present new results and discuss current topics in workshops.

The poster provides an overview of the newly developed simulation methodology of ReSi, the computational engine for the simulation of energy systems.
