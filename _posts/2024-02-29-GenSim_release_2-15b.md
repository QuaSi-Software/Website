We have released version 2.15b of our tool GenSim. This addendum to the latest full release contains various building types as parameter sets ready to be imported. On the basis of this typology new types and custom projects can be modeled more easily than before.

<!--more-->

The types are specific to Germany, but can be adapted with custom parameter values to form new types, that are applicable to other regions.

The release can be found [here](https://github.com/QuaSi-Software/GenSim/releases/tag/v2.15b) and a detailed description of the typology is available [here in the manual](https://quasi-software.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gensim_user_manual/#7-standard-building-typologies).
