[Energiewendebauen](https://www.energiewendebauen.de/) is the official organisation tasked with connecting research groups funded by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and provide a plattform for exchanging the results of research projects. The Projektetreffen are regular conferences where participants of the various research projects can present new results and discuss current topics in workshops.

The poster provides an overview on GenSim, which is described in more detail [in the online documentation](https://quasi-software.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can also read [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/en16176115) on the tool.
